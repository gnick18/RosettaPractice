As you're starting to learn about Rosetta, understanding the breadth of questions it can address is a great way to begin. Rosetta is a powerful suite of programs for macromolecular modeling. Here's a summary of common protein-related questions and the Rosetta tools you can use to tackle them:

*   **Can I predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence alone (de novo)?**
    *   Yes, using the **Rosetta de novo structure prediction algorithm**. This involves assembling short fragments of known protein structures using a Monte Carlo strategy.
    *   Specific tools and protocols include **RosettaAbinitio** (though not explicitly named in these excerpts, it's a key part of the de novo pipeline), and methods leveraging fragment picking.
    *   The **Rosetta server (Robetta)** also offers automated de novo prediction.
    *   Recent advancements like the **trRosetta application** can predict structures without fragments using neural networks.

*   **If I have a protein sequence with some similarity to proteins of known structure, can I build a 3D model?**
    *   Yes, through **comparative modeling** or **homology modeling**.
    *   **RosettaCM** is a specific protocol designed for high-resolution comparative modeling, even with multiple templates.
    *   The **Rosetta server (Robetta)** also uses homology modeling in its predictions.

*   **How can I model loops or structurally variable regions in a protein?**
    *   **Loop modeling** is a specific application within Rosetta.
    *   Various algorithms exist, including **CCD loop modeling**, **Kinematic loop modeling (KIC)**, **Next-generation KIC (NGK)**, and **KIC with fragments**.
    *   **Stepwise assembly** can be used for longer loops.

*   **Can I predict how two or more proteins might interact (protein-protein docking)?**
    *   Yes, **protein–protein docking** is a well-established capability.
    *   **RosettaDock** is the primary module for this. Recent developments include **RosettaDock 4.0** and the ability to incorporate nonprotein moieties and protonation states.
    *   **Rosetta SymDock** is used for docking symmetric protein assemblies.
    *   **Fold-and-dock** can predict structures of symmetric homooligomers.

*   **Can I predict how a small molecule (ligand) might bind to a protein (ligand docking)?**
    *   Yes, **protein–small molecule docking** can be performed.
    *   **RosettaLigand** is the dedicated tool for this, allowing for full side-chain and ligand flexibility.
    *   Protocols can be tailored for flexible XML specifications.

*   **How can I design new proteins with specific structures or functions (de novo protein design)?**
    *   **De novo protein design** is a major application of Rosetta.
    *   The **ROSETTADESIGN algorithm** iteratively optimizes both the sequence and structure.
    *   Specific methods include **SEWING** for designing by recombining structural parts and **RosettaRemodel** for rebuilding parts or all of a structure based on blueprints.
    *   Design can target novel folds, redesigning existing proteins, protein interfaces, and enzymes.

*   **Can I modify the sequence of an existing protein to improve its stability or function (protein redesign)?**
    *   Yes, **protein redesign** is possible using **ROSETTADESIGN** and related tools.
    *   This can involve optimizing sequences for stability, designing protein interfaces, and performing in silico mutagenesis studies.

*   **Can I design proteins that interact with other molecules, like peptides, DNA, or RNA?**
    *   Yes.
    *   **FlexPepDock** is used for flexible peptide-chain docking.
    *   **RosettaDNA** allows for designing and modeling protein interactions with DNA.
    *   Rosetta has capabilities for **RNA structure prediction** and modeling protein-RNA complexes.

*   **Can I incorporate experimental data, such as NMR or cryo-EM data, into my protein modeling?**
    *   Yes.
    *   **RosettaNMR** can be used with paramagnetic restraints and backbone chemical shifts.
    *   **CS-Rosetta** uses NMR chemical shift data for structure prediction.
    *   Methods exist for refinement into cryo-EM density maps (e.g., **ERRASER**) and de novo modeling of protein-RNA complexes into EM densities (**DRRAFTER**).
    *   Experimental constraints can be implemented in comparative modeling using **RosettaRelax** and **RosettaMembrane**.

*   **How can I optimize the structure of a protein model?**
    *   **Model refinement** is a crucial step.
    *   The **Relax** application performs local optimization of structures, including assigning side-chain positions.

*   **Can I model proteins that are embedded in cell membranes (membrane proteins)?**
    *   Yes, Rosetta has specific tools for **membrane protein modeling**.
    *   The **RosettaMP framework** includes tools like `mp_ddg`, `mp_dock`, and `mp_relax`, along with specific energy functions.

*   **How can I model antibodies or other components of the immune system?**
    *   Rosetta has **antibody-specific applications**.
    *   **RosettaAntibody** and **RAbD (RosettaAntibodyDesign)** are specific tools for modeling and design.

*   **Can I work with non-standard amino acids or other non-protein molecules?**
    *   Yes, Rosetta supports **noncanonical amino acids**, **noncanonical backbones**, and **ligands**.
    *   Tools and protocols exist for incorporating these, though they might require specific parameterization.

*   **How can I customize and run Rosetta protocols?**
    *   Rosetta offers **scripting interfaces** for flexibility.
    *   **RosettaScripts** is an XML-based language for defining custom protocols.
    *   **PyRosetta** is a Python-based interface providing direct access to Rosetta objects.

*   **Are there user-friendly ways to interact with Rosetta?**
    *   Yes, several **user interfaces** exist.
    *   **PyRosetta Toolkit** and **InteractiveRosetta** are graphical user interfaces.
    *   **Foldit** is a protein structure prediction game.
    *   **ROSIE** is a web server hosting many Rosetta protocols.
